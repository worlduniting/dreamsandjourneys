   	<p>I found myself standing on the doorstep of a large stone building. I supposed it most resembled a cathedral, yet there was no air of grandeur, nor did it tower like the many cathedrals I had witnessed before. It was quite plain by sight, almost purposefully so. In fact it seemed to wink its portrayal with a sort of irony, as if to mock the very contents that it held.</p>
	   <p>I had become so enthralled with the building that I had not noticed: the hand and the young child that had led me were nowhere to be seen.</p>
	   <p>“Traveler, why have you come?” bellowed a voice that caused the hair on my neck to bristle. There was a guard just to the left of the door that I had not seen. He was suited in an armor that seemed to hide itself in the stone of the building. Had he not spoken, I would not have seen him standing there.</p>
	   <p>“I do not know where I am sir, or why I am standing upon this doorstep. I have surely fallen into a deep and troubling sleep from which only heaven may now awake me.”</p>
	   <p>“From where have you come?” he asked.</p>
	   <p>“Sir, I have come from a place of emptiness. I was gripped in the pull of darkness and chaos. I have never felt such aloneness and despair. A young child took my hand and led me to this place. And now I have come upon it and find myself here before you.”</p>
	   <p>Almost as soon as I stopped speaking he began, “It is from the chaos that you came. All persons have come from nothingness. It is our commonness and it is yours as well. You are and that is your beginning. Now from here journeys your responsibility and from here determines your understanding.”</p>
	   <p>“But sir,” I asked, “I do not know who you are or where I am. I have only just now come upon this building and have found it to be of such curious luster. I feel it begs me to enter. I…”</p>
	   <p>The guard interrupted, in an almost annoyed tone, “I too am a traveler, one who has been tasked to give watch to this dwelling: to see that none should enter, except they be qualified and worthy; to guard against those who would claim falsely their cause. These doors will open for no person except that they be worthy and that I shall agree.”</p>
	   <p>“I would enter, guard. For I am curious to know its contents.”</p>
	   <p>“Are you worthy?” he inquired.</p>
	   <p>“I am not,” I replied. At once, I was taken aback by my own honest speech.</p>
	   <p>He continued his questioning, “Do you trust?”</p>
	   <p>I did not understand what he asked me, but just as before the words came to me as if some stranger spoke in my stead. “I do not.”</p>
	   <p>“Then enter, and be received.” whispered the guard in low tones, difficult to hear.</p>
	   <p>“Tell me how I may enter?” I inquired.</p>
	   <p>“Upon the barren breast of honesty does a person begin their journey. They must not take any precious thing with them, but enter naked, except for the most modest form of covering. For they should not think that they possesses any one thing that is truly their own. Their feet must not be covered, lest they presume the path upon which they walk. They must enter without sight, lest they gaze upon that which appears only to the blinded.”</p>
	   <p>With sudden honesty I replied, “Then I am without, so I am afraid I cannot enter. For I am not now naked, nor are my feet uncovered, nor am I blind.”</p>
	   <p>“What you have spoken is honest and true. He who is from before our time needs no great person to see what you will see. It is his pleasure to entertain those meek of spirit. Yet, be mindful. If you enter this dwelling, if you see, if you understand, you will gain no indulgence. No. You will gain an eternal torture. For you will be the most restless and the most weary of persons. Bliss will never again be your lover. No. She will spite you as your enemy.”</p>
	   <p>He continued, “You may enter, but know this. There is only one owner of this building. He is the one whose name is with us. It is he we beheld, the one of a most barren breast. With our own eyes, we saw further light, and with our own hands, we touched three great lights. Upon this very threshold his name is commanded and to the one who wills it, a further truth awaits.”</p>
	   <p>I gazed upon the base of the door. Words in some unknown script were written upon it.</p>
	   <p>
	      <img src="script.png" alt="The Cathedral"/> 
	   </p>
	   <p>“Sir, I cannot read these words for they are in a language I have not learned.”</p>
	   <p>The guard explained, “The language is one covered from all men, except for those in hiding who are covered by a lamb’s sacrifice. With wisdom alone shall a person ever read its meaning.”</p>
	   <p>“Can you tell me what it means?” I exclaimed.</p>
	   <p>“I am only the guardian of this lodging who has been called to attend to your entrance.”</p>
	   <p>I pressed on, “Then, with eyes that are blind, thirsting for light, with ears that are longing for learning, and with a tongue starved for inquiry, guardian, I would enter.”</p>
	   <p>“Then enter into a pilgrim’s progress. Upon this door’s opening you will enter into the Room of Preparation. It is a shelter of darkness, empty of all light. In it you will rid yourself of all which you consider your possessions. Do not be afraid, but do as you are told. You will be a friend there, and will suffer no harm. The Deacon will see to your journey.”</p>
	   <p>Just as soon as he stopped speaking, he reached to the door, grasped the large cast-iron knocker and rapped on the door with a certain number of distinct knocks. I witnessed the door open with a slow and deliberate task. The hinges cried out as if to beg me to attend to their age and to their rare use. I could not see what lay within. Only darkness and uncertainty stood before me.</p>
	   <p>Fearful of the very uncertain path ahead of me, yet curious to gain entrance, I stepped across the threshold.</p>
	   <p>So began my journey.</p>
