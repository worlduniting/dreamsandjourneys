		<p>Darkness was all I perceived at first: empty, cold, and alone. Expanse extending within expanse and endlessness extending within endlessness. Nothingness was not as I had imagined it, as something to be witnessed; it was nothing, if that were possible. I pained to find its end and cried out in a void which swallowed my sound and hid it in its shroud. I gasped at the silence, drawing in a crushing realization of sorrow, for I was without, with no one to hear, nothing to consider, and alone.</p>
		<p>Then, either for fear or for flight I found myself stepping forward. Beneath my feet I discovered there was some surface to walk upon. Relieved to find a method of escape I began to move ever more quickly with each step. Sounds of voices echoed from distant places, calling from the darkness, saying words I could not comprehend. The air was crisp, dry and thin. It seemed to produce a great thirst in me as I walked on and on.</p>
		<p>Whereas, at first, all I could distinguish was darkness, soon my eyes adjusted. I perceived in the distance small glimmers of light that seemed to flicker and move. In fact, as I focused more clearly on one directly ahead of me I noticed it was moving closer and closer to me. I stopped my walk and became at once afraid of what may be causing this light to approach.</p>
		<p>Soon I discovered that it was not a light, but a flame which came from a lamp held by some person approaching. I stood perfectly still hoping that they would not see me in the darkness but would pass me by. I would have preferred the naiveté of the darkness to this mystery. Instead, they came upon me with great speed.</p>
		<p>“Come with me, Traveler,” said the voice of a young child.</p>
		<p>I had not expected to hear a child’s voice. This was a place of darkness. It seemed unusual, even unsafe for such a young person. The child was clothed in a robe which seemed a radiant white against the light of the flame. But as it came closer I discovered that its face was of no particular beauty, but instead seemed scarred. Unsure of the reality of this apparition I reached out and felt before me to test its reality.</p>
		<p>“Take my hand,” spoke the child as it reached out toward me.</p>
		<p>The cold fingers grasped my hand tightly. My skin prickled with fear. I tore my hand away and jumped back, shouting in a trembling voice, “Who are you?!”</p>
		<p>“I am a traveler like yourself. I offer you understanding, but you must come with me. Do not linger here or you will become like the voices you hear in the distance. I came for them too, but they did not follow. Will you come?”</p>
		<p>“Who are you and why are you in this place? If I follow you where will we go?” I asked.</p>
		<p>“It is not yet time for you to ask these questions, but I will lead you to a place where darkness cannot hide. There you will ask the questions you desire, but for now you must trust. Yes. Do not trust simply because I am here, or because I hold this meager light, but because I offer you this opportunity. However you must be silent and attentive to my lead or I will lose you in this void.”</p>
		<p>“Then take me there. I will follow. I wish to be free of this place and my mind is filled with curiosity. I will trust,” I answered.</p>
		<p>So I reached out and took the cold hand. The young child began to lead me on through the darkness, stating, “Be mindful of your step, fellow traveler, for there are many sharp and treacherous things in this place.” We hastened stopping only briefly from time to time so the child could look upon a parchment of some sort; then would quicken our pace again.</p>
		<p>As before, I began to become quite thirsty from the dry air. I asked the child, “Please. Do you have even a small amount of water? Our walking and this air have made me quite thirsty.”</p>
		<p>The child reached from within its robe and revealed a flask which shimmered a brilliant red against the lamp’s flame. “Drink this Traveler, it will quench your thirst for now. But soon we must journey to a place where you may gather your own.”</p>
		<p>I took the flask from the child and placed it to my lips to drink. I was surprised to find the contents to be warm in this cold place, tasting sweet as nectar, quenching my thirst with only a small amount. I gave the flask back to the child who hid it away and quickly led us on.</p>
		<p>As we continued I began to distinguish a brighter light off in the distance, though it seemed clouded in the darkness. It was originating from a building. The brilliance emanating from it seemed to reach out to me. I felt as if it was calling me, drawing me to it.</p>
		<p>To my greatest relief we came quickly upon it.</p>
