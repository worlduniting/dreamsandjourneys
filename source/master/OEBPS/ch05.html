		<p>We were walking for a great distance in the chamber. Being of such coarse nature, the floor began to pain my feet a great deal. In fact, it became almost unbearable. I turned to the Deacon and asked, “Please, Deacon, my feet are not used to this path and it is quite distracting. May I have some covering for them or perhaps slow my pace?”</p>
		<p>The Deacon rebuked me, saying, “Do you find yourself to be of a quality greater than those who came before you, Traveler? They endured such triviality as you. Do you consider yourself of a nobler nature than those who suffered to the point of death for what you will gain? Be quiet! You will not be burdened beyond what you can bear. Do not look up again, but be mindful of your path.”</p>
		<p>So I looked down upon my feet again as we continued, angle upon angle, to the next great throne.</p>
		<p>At last, we came to a stop and again the Deacon took the staff from under his arm and rapped purposefully with it a certain number of distinct times.</p>
		<p>“Who comes here?” spoke the tender voice of a woman.</p>
		<p>Again, the Deacon answered, “It is a traveler who desires to learn of you.”</p>
		<p>“Has he discerned Revelation’s Art?”</p>
		<p>“He has asked and he has received and he seeks to ask again,” the Deacon responded.</p>
		<p>“Then let him ask as he will, for I will hold no reserve but will give as I have received.”</p>
		<p>Then she spoke to me, saying, “Look upon me, Traveler, and tell me what you perceive.”</p>
		<p>I looked up and saw the second great throne and the one who sat upon it.</p>
		<p>I began, saying, “I see a young and beautiful woman, dressed in a brilliant white robe of fine linen. Your right eye appears to be a diamond of great purity and brilliance. Over your left eye there lays a covering of cloth that seems to conceal your eye’s absence. Your throne is of a most brilliant purity and seems to be carved from a single diamond. Upon its base are written the words, “EYE FOR AN EYE.” In your left hand you hold a scale in perfect balance that holds what appear to be two precious stones. On one side of the scale is a stone that resembles your right eye. On the other side there appears to be a stone of equal quality, but whose luster shines red. In your right hand you hold a shepherd’s rod. The arm that holds it is bound by three strong cords. In your lap there lies a large book with a pen which continues to write in its pages.”</p>
		<p>“Traveler, know this. You may ask as you wish and I will reveal as I am able. But my knowledge and my task are without remorse.”</p>
		<p>“Are you Justice?” I questioned.</p>
		<p>“I am called Justice, for my purpose is just and right.”</p>
		<p>“Forgive me, but why do you mention that your knowledge and task are without remorse?”</p>
		<p>Patiently she replied, “Many have come before you, Traveler. You will meet them on your journey. Many have asked as you will and have heard what I share, but they have not desired to acknowledge its merit. The reality of it pains them for their actions are called into account and are no longer without consequence. Their disregard is foolishness and folly. They have not realized that their stubborn arrogance will not release them from my purpose.”</p>
		<p>“What is your purpose, Justice?”</p>
		<p>“I have been called to attend to the creator’s debts. He has tasked me to measure on the Scale of Right, to exact what is owed him, and to separate out those who have been written in his book,” she stated.</p>
		<p>“Justice, may I ask who owes this debt to which you tend and how they have accrued it?”</p>
		<p>“Behold the place where my eye once dwelt.”</p>
		<p>“Yes. I see that it no longer remains and I find myself distraught to look upon it. How did you come to be in such a state?” I haltingly asked.</p>
		<p>“It was humankind who reached out and plucked my eye from its place.”</p>
		<p>Appalled, I questioned, “Justice, tell me. How is it that they have come to accomplish such a ghastly act?”</p>
		<p>Looking down toward me she began, “The creator who fashioned their existence has from time immemorial lavished his affection upon them. It was his pleasure to attend to their creation. From the dust of the earth he intended them unique from all other creation, the greatest of his good and mastered work. Such was his devotion that he even cast their mold after the very likeness of his being, his person.”</p>
		<p>She continued, “They were given a most unique privilege among all of the creator’s creatures. Within them was placed the gift to reason. Their's was the ability to choose freely their companionship to the creator. It was his decision to do so, for he longed to commune with a creature who could purpose to love him.”</p>
		<p>Warily, I asked, “Justice, forgive me, but what manner of choice did humankind possess in their companionship with the creator? Choice would seem to presume the presence of some option. But what option could they have chosen if they and all of creation were good? Love would presume the freedom and ability to act in some wrong manner toward someone.”</p>
		<p>Pleased, she answered, “Your question is wise, Traveler. It was for that reason that the creator placed in the center of his creation the measure for their choice, a tree which provided their ability to offend. It was this tree that the creator compelled them not to eat of. By so doing, he gave them the ability to demonstrate choice. Their act of agreement then demonstrated their desire to commune with and to love the creator. By doing so they would continue the joy of living in their state of creation. However, their choice to disregard this simple request would sever them from the creator’s ability to commune with them. It would introduce the misuse of nature, creating an unintended and injured state of creation.”</p>
		<p>“So humankind desired what was not theirs to possess. Rather than seeing the tree for its purpose of choice and love for their creator, they were deceived. They fashioned in their mind that they would be governed by no one; though, the creator never desired to govern, only to commune. So they reached toward the tree and took from its fruit and ate of its consequence of offense. So they reached to the creator himself and tore from him the creature whom he loved. For the creator would no longer be able to dwell with them in their consequenced state of giving and receiving injury. It was then that humankind snatched the eye from me, and it was then that the cost of it was placed upon the Scale of Right.”</p>
		<p>“I, Justice, must now demand collection for what man has stolen, an eye for an eye. I will exact from humanity what they have taken: a creature without corruption and eternal.”</p>
		<p>“But Justice, what person can pay such a cost? For who among us may claim to be without error? Even upon a person’s birth do they find their body genetically corrupted.”</p>
		<p>Sighing, she replied, “Indeed, Traveler. There is no person who may afford this debt.”</p>
		<p>“Then how will they pay what is owed their creator?”</p>
		<p>“They must meet the cost, an eye for an eye,” she answered.</p>
		<p>Shaken by her words, I whispered to myself, “This is a grim state. It is hard to reconcile a creator who loves his creation and yet would exact such a cost.”</p>
		<p>She retorted, “Traveler, be warned! Have I not said that my knowledge and task are without remorse? Such humor humanity possesses, that they would beg for Justice! They beg not to be righted, but instead to blind and to be blinded. Let no one pray for Justice, for justice will be granted, and that forthrightly.”</p>
		<p>Shaking her head she warned, “Do not be deceived. It was not the creator who has wronged humanity. It is humanity who has hastened their own demise. And such a cost: that all of creation should suffer from their selfish ambition. They caused the scale to be unevened and it is their debt to pay.”</p>
		<p>Disconcerted, I looked over to her left hand and the scale in it. “Forgive me, but as I look upon the scale in your hand I do not find it to be uneven. Rather, it is in perfect balance. Your eye is on the one side; but on the other, a different gem of a red luster is placed.”</p>
		<p>“Yes,” she breathed. “The scale has been evened and the debt reconciled.”</p>
		<p>“But who has done this, Justice? Who has paid this debt? Who in all creation was even able,” I questioned, astounded.</p>
		<p>Came her simple reply, “The creator himself.”</p>
		<p>“But how did he do this?”</p>
		<p>“He has reached up and plucked out his own remaining eye. For he alone, being eternal and without offense, was of such a nature to satisfy the debt. He took upon himself the form of his creature, permitting them to make payment with his own life. Understand, it is the eye of Mercy that lies upon the scale as payment. He has met an eye for an eye. What was perfectly demanded has been perfectly met.”</p>
		<p>Almost speechless, I said, “Then humankind is free from their obligation?”</p>
		<p>“Their debt has been met, but the creator has left it for man to decide. It is humanity’s choice to receive his gift of reconciliation just as it was humanity’s choice to refuse it. They are a creature of free choosing. The creator has always desired their love, not their obligation. Behold the rod which I hold in my right hand, and the book which lies upon my lap.”</p>
		<p>“The rod appears to be a shepherd’s rod and the book is authored by a pen which appears to be writing names,” I observed.</p>
		<p>“Behold the Creator’s Staff. It is indeed a shepherd’s rod, for I have been tasked to separate the sheep from the goats, the wheat from the weed, yes, even the chosen from the nay-choosers.”</p>
		<p>“Justice, who will you separate and when will this task be accomplished?” I wondered.</p>
		<p>“I shall wield this staff soon Traveler. With its length I will reach out and call out all from creation who have trusted and reasoned what Revelation has demonstrated.”</p>
		<p>Curiously, I inquired, “What will be your measure be for this?”</p>
		<p>She replied, “I will call out those who have been written in this book: who have clothed the naked, fed the starving, taken-in the stranger, given drink to the thirsty: those who, like the creator, have been merciful and have not required a person’s sacrifice. The pen which you have seen writes the names of those who have taken Mercy's hand. Those who have been written have been reconciled. Their debts will not be counted against them. Neither will I exact the creator’s debt from them. No, theirs will be a reward.”</p>
		<p>“Please, Justice,” I begged, “Why is your arm restrained? What are the three cords?”</p>
		<p>“They are the permissions of the other three thrones. Mercy must resist time no more. Virtue shall truly die. Revelation will lay down his brush and his pen. Upon that moment, my staff will move most quickly and accurately to attend to its purpose.”</p>
		<p>“Come. Deacon, give to him a new robe: pure and brilliant as the rightness of the creator himself. Truly, Traveler, he has reconciled you. Your debt has already been paid once and for all time. And when he extends his eyes upon you, upon his own rightness will he now gaze.”</p>
		<p>“You have learned of my exactness and now must discern Mercy’s Sorrow, for the creator longs for his creation,” she finished.</p>
		<p>The Deacon held open a robe of magnificent purity. I placed my arms into it. Then the Deacon pulled the hood over my head and tied the robe around my waist. He then took my arm and, again, commanded me to look down upon my path, reminding me that I should not look up, nor become distracted by anything around me.</p>
		<p>Following his bidding, I looked down and saw my feet, which had now become swollen and blistered. I continued following the Deacon as he led me in the strange and confusing path, worried about the further truth which would befall me, toward Mercy’s throne.</p>
