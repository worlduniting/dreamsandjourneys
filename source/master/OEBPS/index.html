		<p>To the brave soul who followed God's call to a small Bible College in ND, held up a black leather-bound book, and without presumption for my knowledge, started from the beginning, declaring, "This is a Bible."</p>
		<p>Thank you, Mac, for letting me ask my intellectually honest questions. To my greatest relief they found a listening ear, an informed mind, and a heart of compassion.</p>
		<p>Having now considered, conversed, and contended with so many great minds and works, I find myself often harkening to the memory of that small college and cherishing the reminiscence of my fellow youthful students of faith: brilliant, determined, passionate, chilled by the snow, fired by the Spirit of God.</p>

			<p>“Dreams &amp; Journeys: The Cathedral (Part One)” is a work that was written for the purpose of introducing a very basic notion of what is commonly called the Christian worldview. It is an allegorical story set in the dreams of the main character, the Traveler.</p>
	   	<p>This work came largely from my own desire to walk through and clarify my own faith (a never ending journey) as I have come to understand it through the collection of writings commonly called “The Bible.” That said, I also had hoped to fashion a creative and imaginative means to contemplate what are often very complicated concepts in this belief system.</p>
	   	<p>Each of the characters the Traveler encounters are meant to represent ideas and conversations regarding basic concepts from this worldview. The dialogues between the characters also serve to address what are commonly asked questions of this belief. These are not meant to be elaborate discussions, but rather serve to facilitate the consideration of such matters and provide a hopeful path toward exploration.</p>
	   	<p>It is my grave request that the reader extend me the liberty of errancy in this work. Like all other persons, I am seeking to journey toward what is an unrelenting conundrum: the certainty of truth. Still, though the journey may be immeasurably complicated, the benefit of its challenge is unmistakable. I pray others will continue to unceasingly champion the same journey.</p>
	  	<p>Last, I would ask the reader to forgive the use of the masculine gender in reference to the "creator" in this work. It was a choice for poetic convention. In point of fact, within the Judeo-Christian worldview, the creator has never referred to “himself” as being male, or female, but wonderfully, as our human history records it, only as “I AM.”</p>
			<p>Thank you for your consideration of this work. May God continually grant us the patience, empathy, and fortitude to valiantly maintain our often regrettably outgrown child-like curiosity, and so never apologize for unceasingly using the word “Why?”</p>
